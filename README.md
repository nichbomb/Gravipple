"# GravityGrappler" 
GravityGrappler is a 2d physics based game where you control a control gravity and black holes to move your character around. Try to collect stars while avoiding asteroids.
Controls:
    * SPACE: pulls your character towards the nearest black hole.
    * Arrow Keys: Change the direction of gravity that affects your character and the asteroids.
     
Whenever you collect a star, a red asteroid appears, making the game become increasingly more difficult as gameplay progresses.

This game was made during the HackEd 2020 Hackathon. We used the Phaser 3 game engine which works with Javascript to build the game.
