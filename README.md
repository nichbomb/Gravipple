"# Gravipple" 
Grappity is a 2d platformer game where you control a circle trying to traverse an obstacle course. There are two main mechanics, grappling and gravity. 
You can grapple onto the nearest square by using SPACE which sends out a rope that lets you swing from that square. Pressing SPACE while hooked to a square detaches you, maintaining your previous velocity.
You can change the direction of gravity by using WASD to move your circle around.

The playerâ€™s goal is to move through a map with triangle hazards to reach a goal. If you hit a triangle, you restart at the beginning.
The player can collect bonus stars that are challenging to reach, for a bonus.
The player progresses by reaching a diamond at the end of each level.

This game was made using Unity game engine for the HackEd 2020 Hackathon.
